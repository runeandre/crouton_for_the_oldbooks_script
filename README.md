# crouton_for_the_oldbooks_script
A script that modified crouton to work on older Chromebooks with Chrome OS 75

Just download and run the `run_crouton_for_oldbooks` script in Linux and a bash terminal.
```
./run_crouton_for_oldbooks
```

Requires: Linux (or MacOS?), bash, git, make (build-utils) and python3 (http.server)

A prebuilt version is also hosted here on github: [https://github.com/runeandre/crouton_for_the_oldbooks]
This version runs using github, and doesn't require the use of this script.
